# Roadmap

Development is milestone-driven. Each milestone is implemented, documented, verified, and reviewed before the next begins.

## Phase 0 — Firmware foundation

1. Repository initialization — complete.
2. STM32F405 build and boot foundation — complete; physical-board verification remains recorded.
3. Board and MCU hardware-layer skeleton — complete.
4. Monotonic microsecond timebase — complete.
5. Task abstraction — complete.
6. Cooperative scheduler — complete.
7. Application state machine — complete.
8. Fault system — complete.
9. Non-blocking logging core — complete.
10. USB CDC logging backend — complete.
11. USB newline-delimited JSON command foundation — complete.
12. Structured health reporting — complete.
13. Integration review — implemented; awaiting owner review.

Phase 0 does not control motors, decode receiver input, or use sensor data for flight.

## Later phases

| Phase | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | DShot actuator subsystem controlled by safe USB bench commands |
| 2 | ELRS/CRSF receiver input, normalization, freshness, and diagnostics |
| 3 | Open-loop receiver-to-motor integration and first controlled physical response |
| 4 | BMI270-based estimation and stabilized flight, followed by optional BMP388 use |
| 5 | Non-blocking structured microSD flight-data logging |
| 6 | Optional external peripherals such as GPS |
| 7 | Evidence-driven Flight Computer V2 review |

After first-flight capability exists, add a separate evidence-driven vehicle
condition and flight-phase layer. It may infer conditions such as `LANDED`,
`IN_FLIGHT`, and `CRASHED`, plus a higher-level readiness/health assessment
based on functional checks. Its exact state model, confidence requirements,
sensor inputs, and control authority must be designed from flight evidence; it
is not required for first flight and is not part of the current deterministic
lifecycle state machine.

Simulation, GUI configuration, autonomous navigation, computer vision, a bootloader, and any RTOS migration are later evidence-driven work rather than part of the current foundation.

Once independently versioned host software such as a GUI must communicate with
older deployed firmware, define protocol-version identifiers, compatibility
rules, and migration behavior. USB authentication or cryptography is likewise
deferred until after first-flight capability and a concrete threat model; the
current USB interface remains a physically trusted bench/development channel.
